Used Wordpress, custom pages, post types and taxonmoies were made. Used a starter theme to have all the starting files in place and were vastly edited to adhere to the final output.

Project also included:
HTML5/CSS3
SASS
PHP
Wordpress
Gulp
Visualcode
Javascript
Creating widgets and plugins for Wordpress
Used a variety of plugins made by other vendors

It was a challenging project, trying to understand difference between page.php and single.php and other similarities. Knowing when to use Wordpress to make a page and images and when to use VisualCode. I am still interested in Wordpress
